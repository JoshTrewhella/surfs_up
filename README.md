## Overview of the analysis
Our client has asked us to analyze 12 months for percipitation and temperature data in Oahu, Hawaii for an investment in a surf shop.

We are exploring a potential investment in a shop that combines the concepts of a surf shot and an ice cream shop. We used SQLite to parse the data analyze the differences between June and December.

## Results
June Results

- June has 1700 results with an average of 75 degrees.
- The maximum temperate was 85 and a minimum of 64 degrees. 

December Results

- December has 1517 results with an aveage of 71 degrees.
- The maximum temperature was 83 and a minimum of 56

## Summary
Using numpy, I was able to also get the mode of June (76 degrees) and December (71 degrees).

As a result, we can see the temperatures in Oahu are consistent and would be a great location for the proposed surf and ice cream shop.
